            <h1>My Favourite Place ~ PARIS</h1>
            <span></span>
            <p1>I love to travel places.My favourite place i wish to visit is paris.From its bustling river banks, the beauty and charm of its architecture, the delicious food, countless opportunities to explore art, culture, and history—the reasons i love Paris are as diverse as the city itself. The city is full of beautiful sights. One of the most prominent sights is the Eiffel Tower. While standing on the top of this splendid building, you can see the whole Paris city. On the whole, the city’s climate during the whole year is pleasant and fairly moist. </p1>
